## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node

My focus went to making things work server side. Learning how to utilize the pathing and how to manuveur through pages and actions.

## Optimizations

It would be cool to place a random Darth Vadar quote each time instead of the one that is available.

## Lessons Learned:

Pathing things within the server can be very interesting anf fun. Pathing issues can give so much stress however haha.
